In React Native, a less common error arises when using the `FlatList` component with a complex data structure or improper key extraction.  If your data items don't have unique keys, or if the keys change unexpectedly, `FlatList` may exhibit unpredictable behavior, such as incorrect rendering, item duplication, or crashes.  This is often more difficult to debug than simple rendering errors because the problem might not be immediately apparent in the data itself, leading to an investigation into component lifecycle or state management.
